# Population-Data
# Mengqi Xu
# The background of this project is the map of China.
# On top of it, there is a bubble chart where the size of the bubble represents the population of most populated cities in China.
# And when pointing to each bubble, the bubble will get clearer and bigger, with the population number shown.
# The data is coming from http://www.phbang.cn/city/12523.html
# And the scale code is borrowed from http://openprocessing.org/sketch/187260
